print("""Caught in space and time
Like a bird in a cage
Cruelly confined
In a passing matters state
You suddenly realize
That the wrong is the right
Daring the laws
Ready to put up a fight
But...
Love will drag your heart away
To a world where dreams are made
Can't hide away
When your helpless mind obeys
Together we wait in silence (Still are the cries)
Forever the fate is hungry for your soul
Together we wait in silence (Still are the cries)
Worth your while until you're gone
All the secrets of life reveal
To my eyes I can't conceal
And again I fly away
To a world where dreams are made
Together we wait in silence (Still are the cries)
Forever the fate is hungry for your soul
Together we wait in silence (Still are the cries)
Worth your while until you're gone
Life's too short to grieve in sorrow (Still are the cries)
Fate is waiting for your soul (Secrets inside)
Live your life like no tomorrow (Still are the cries)
Worth you're while until you're gone
Fate's gonna take your soul!""") #Usar 3 aspas, facilita esse processo de printar um texto longo)
